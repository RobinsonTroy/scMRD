Processing multiplexed single cell MRD data in R

We are working on compiling all scripts into a full tutorial, which we will link here once it is completed. In the meantime, please refer to the Scripts folder to find code used in the analysis for the manuscript analysis. 

Please note that all necessary data (in the form of .h5 files) to reproduce the code used in this project are available under dbGAP study accession phs003233.v1.p1.
